<h1 align="center">Hello! I'm Manthan Wattamwar ðŸ‘‹</h1>

Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student at USC, graduating in May 2025, passionate about building impactful solutions. Currently, Iâ€™m looking for full-time software roles where I can apply my skills in software development, full-stack engineering, machine learning, and cybersecurity.

Recently, I worked at Delet, where I developed a three-way conversational chatbot and a low-latency video streaming solution for apartment self-touring. My solution not only made it to production but also significantly reduced hardware costs. Before that, I spent a year at Cognizant Technology Solutions, managing authentication and authorization for clients using Okta SSO and automating tasks to improve efficiency

Beyond work, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to challenging projectsâ€”whether itâ€™s publishing machine learning research, winning hackathons and robotics competitions, or founding a drone and tech club focused on autonomous drones and embedded systems. I enjoy building full-stack applications, working with AI-driven solutions, and exploring new technologies.

Iâ€™m also actively involved in leadership, having served as President and Treasurer of student organizations, where I helped organize large-scale hackathons and cultural events at USC. I thrive in fast-paced environments, love collaborating with teams, and believe in constant learning and adaptation.

If you're working on something exciting or looking for someone who enjoys tackling complex problems, let's connect! ðŸš€
